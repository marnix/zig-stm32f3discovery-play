Ideas:

- Try to do some more creative blinking.

- Use STM32F303.svd from Git submodule.

- Publish on GitHub.
  (Update README.md to match the actual content.)

- Generate linker.ld based on https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/tree/master/ld.
  (Perhaps as part of `zig build`? make libopencm3 a submodule probably.)

- Try out the other hardware on the STM32F3DISCOVERY board.
